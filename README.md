# Welcome to React Router!

```
npm run dev
```

# Input

I didn't know much about React router going into this PE but I see it is much like next.js and others and does make things easier.

# Process

For this process I found that the official React Router guide was very helpful (address book) and I switched much if it to fix the cities model. Going over it twice with building both apps was helpful to reinforce knowledge gained on first pass.

# Output

I believe I have a much stronger understanding of certain React Router paradigms.
